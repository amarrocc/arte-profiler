vs.



      Characterization<br>
    </h2>
    Some of the terminology can be confusing. Many people are initially
    confused about the difference between <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">Calibration</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Characterization/Profiling</span>.<br>
    <h3>What is Calibration ?</h3>
    "Calibration" is a short hand Graphic Arts term for adjusting a
    devices behavior to meet calibration targets.<br>
    Calibration is the process of modifying the color behavior of a
    device. This is typically done using two mechanisms:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Changing controls or internal settings that it
    has.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Applying curves to its color channels.<br>
    <br>
    The idea of calibration is to put a device in a defined state with
    regard to its color response. Often this is used as a day to day
    means of maintaining reproducible behavior. Calibration is often the
    most practical way of setting parameters such as white point and
    brightness of displays. Typically calibration will be stored in
    device or systems specific file formats that record the device
    settings and/or per channel calibration curves.<br>
    <br>
    For some specific applications (such as Video playback), calibration
    may be used to allow a video signal with a specific encoding (i.e.
    colorspace) to display correctly on a display without color
    management software or hardware being needed to transform between
    color spaces. For each source colorspace, a specific calibration
    needs to be made for the display, and the display can only show one
    source correctly at a time. If you have N source color spaces, and M
    displays, then N x M calibrations would need to be created to
    display any source on any display.
    <h3>What is Characterization/Profiling ?</h3>
    Characterization (or <span style="font-weight: bold;">profiling</span>)
    is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recording</span> the
    way a device reproduces or responds to color. Typically the result
    is stored in a device <span style="font-weight: bold;">ICC</span>
    profile. Such a profile does not in itself modify color in any way.
    What it does is allow a system such as a CMM (Color Management
    Module) or color aware application to modify color when combined
    with another device profile. Only by knowing the characteristics of
    two devices or colorspaces, can a way of transferring color from one
    device representation to another be achieved.<br>
    <br>
    Given a source profile and a destination (i.e. display) profile, a
    direct transform can be computed between the two. In ICC terminology
    this is a <b>Device Link</b>.<br>
    The benefit of managing color this way is that such transforms can
    be created on the fly between any source colorspace and the display,
    and all the results rendered into the same output. Many sources with
    different color spaces, or color spaces that are unknown at the time
    of profiling the display can be rendered correctly. If you have N
    source colorspaces and M displays, then only N + M profiles need to
    be created to display any source on any display.<br>
    <br>
    Note that a characterization (profile) will only be valid for a
    device if it is in the same state of calibration as it was when it
    was characterized/profiled.<br>
    <h3>What about display calibration and profiles ?</h3>
    In the case of display profiles there is some additional confusion
    because often the <span style="font-weight: bold;">calibration</span>
    information is stored in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">profile</span>
    for convenience. By convention it is stored in a tag called the
    'vcgt' tag. Although it is stored in the profile, none of the normal
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">ICC</span> based tools or
    applications are aware of it, or do anything with it, it is just
    "along for the ride". Similarly, typical display calibration tools
    and applications will not be aware of, or do anything with the ICC
    characterization (profile) information.<br>
