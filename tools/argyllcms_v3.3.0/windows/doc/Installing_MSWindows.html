    You will need to unzip the downloaded file in the location you have
    chosen to hold the executable files (perhaps somewhere like <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">\bin</span>). I would <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> put them in <span
      style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files</span>, since spaces in
    directory or file names and command line environments are a very bad
    mix, and will cause you endless problems. The archive will create a
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> top level directory <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X</span>, where X.X.X is
    the version number, and the executables will be in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X\bin</span>.
    <h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Making the tools
        accessible:</span></h3>
    You should also configure your %PATH% environment variable to give
    access to the executables from your command line environment.<br>
    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 8</span>, <b>8.1, 10
      &amp; 11</b>, look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Desktop
    -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System And Security -&gt;
    System -&gt; Advanced System Settings -&gt; Environment Variables<br>

    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vista</span>, look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Menu -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System And
    Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Change Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt;

    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">XP </span>look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control
    Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Environment Variables<br>
    <br>
    You want to add the directory you've chosen to your %PATH%, which is
    a System Variable. Normally you would add this to the end of the
    current setting, separated by a ';'.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;So if the current value of PATH is
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%" and you unpacked Argyll version
    3.1.0 in <span style="font-weight: bold;">d:\bin\</span>, then you
    would modify PATH to be
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;d:\bin\Argyll_V3.1.0\bin", -
    i.e. you append the path to the Argyll binaries to your PATH,
    separated by the ';' character. The change will take effect when you
    start a new command shell, which you start from Start
    Menu-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt, or Start
    Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt. You can check
    that the environment variable has been set by running the command
    "echo %PATH%" in the command shell.<br>
    <br>
    The .zip file also contains several useful reference files (such as
    scanner chart recognition templates, sample illumination spectrum
    etc.) in the ref sub-directory, all the current documentation in a
    doc sub-directory, and instrument USB drivers in the usb directory.<br>

    relies on systems having a sound card and speakers's installed and

    beeps have gone when using <a href="chartread.html">chartread</a>,
    now you know.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: Microsofts generic VGA Driver</span>
    does not appear to support setting the graphics card VideoLUTs. You
    will need to install a display driver for your specific display
    hardware to enable this. Note also that it is possible in many cases
    to use Windows 7 video drivers on Windows 8 systems etc.. If you are
    having trouble accessing the VideoLUTs, then check in Device Manager
    that you are running the correct driver for your card, and not using
    the fallback generic driver.<br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> that if you wish to use
    Argyll tools (<a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a>) to control display
    calibration, that you will have to disable any other display
    calibration loader programs.<br>
    <h3><u><font color="#cc0000"><a name="BadSoftware"></a>Other
          software that may interfere with display calibration loading
          and USB instrument access:</font></u></h3>
    There are other programs that will interfere with calibration
    loading, such as igfxpers.exe that gets installed with <b>nVidia
      "Optimus"</b> technology.<br>
    You may have to disable both the igfx tray module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxtray.exe) and the igfxpph Module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxpph.dll) in addition to the persistence
    Module (c:\windows\system32\igfxpers.exe).<br>
    <br>
    A good tool for this is <a
      href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902">AutoRuns</a>.
    Note that the igfxpph module may exist in several locations and you
    have to disable all of them. Reboot after changing settings.<br>
    <br>
    It has also been reported that some RGB LED driver services will
    interfere with USB instrument access. A known culprit is the <b>Logitech

      LampArray Service</b> which may be have been installed with
    Logitech software or by default in <b>MSWindows 11</b>. Other <b>RGB

      LED drivers</b> and services such as <b>Gigabyte RGBFusion</b>
    have also been reported as interfering with USB instrument access.
    You may need to identify all such services and disable or uninstall
    them.<br>
    <br>
    Also reported to interfere with access to instruments, is <b>TeamSpeak3.</b>
    You may need to disable or upgrade to TeamSpeak5 to avoid issues.<br>
    Some services are reported to interfere with access to instruments,
    such as Mountain's <b>BaseCamp.Service</b>. You may need to disable
    or uninstall this service for instruments to be recognized.<br>

    <h3><font color="#ff6600"><u><a name="USB"></a>USB Instruments:</u></font></h3>
    If you are using a USB connected instrument, then suitable <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">USB system drivers</span> may need to
    be installed.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span>Note that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Huey</span>,
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">i1 Display Pro</span>, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki Display</span> and <b>ColorHug</b>
    colorimeter appears as an <b>HID</b> (USB Human Interface Device
    Class) device, and hence will be assigned to the default MSWindows
    HID driver. You therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;
      text-decoration: underline;">don't need</span> to install an
    Argyll <span style="font-weight: bold;">usb</span> system driver
    for these instruments, although it is possible to select the
    libusb0.sys driver as an alternative to the default HID driver.<br>
    <br>
    If you are using the <b>JETI</b> specbos <b>1211</b><b>,&nbsp;</b><b>1201</b><b>,
      1511, 1501</b> and the <b>Klien K10A</b><b></b> then you may need
    to install the <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI















      Virtual COM Port Drivers</a> (VCP), if they are not already on
    your system. You may have to update to the latest FTDI driver to
    work with the FTDI FT231XS chip that the <b>JETI</b> specbos <b>1511,















      1501</b> use.<br>

    <a name="libusb"></a>For all operating system versions you can
    install the ArgyllCMS libusb0.sys driver by navigating to your
    ArgyllCMS installation usb directory, and running <b>ArgyllCMS_install_USB.exe</b>.
    This will trigger a UAC prompt which you will have to agree to to
    proceed. You may have to re-plug an instrument for the new driver to
    be picked up.<br>
    <br>
    To uninstall the ArgyllCMS libusb0.sys driver, navigate to your
    ArgyllCMS installation usb directory, and run <b>ArgyllCMS_uninstall_USB.exe</b>.
    This will trigger a UAC prompt which you will have to agree to to
    proceed.<br>
    <br>
    If you need to update the driver because support for a new
    instrument has been added, then run&nbsp; <b>ArgyllCMS_uninstall_USB.exe</b>
    followed by <b>ArgyllCMS_install_USB.exe</b>.<br>

        <br>
      </span></span> If you currently have applications other than
    Argyll accessing your USB connected instrument, then you will have
    to manually install the Argyll driver, and then switch back and
    forth between the Argyll and other drivers if you want to switch
    between applications.<br>
    <br>
    If you are using a recent version of Microsoft Windows and want to <u>often</u>
    switch between using ArgyllCMS and the OEM driver, you can try using
    a different physical USB port for each installation, as this
    reportedly avoids the need to manually switch drivers.<br>
